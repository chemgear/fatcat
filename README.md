A Streamlit application to track the food consumption of three cats: Mittens, Cheddar, and Lola.

## Features

- Track initial food weight for each cat's bowl
- Record remaining food weight to calculate consumption
- Beautiful, interactive UI with individual tracking for each cat
- 30-day historical graphs showing:
  - Initial food weight
  - Remaining food weight
  - Consumed food (the difference)
- Persistent storage using SQLite database
